# Advanced JavaScript Homework 01

## Overview
This repository contains three tasks as part of the Advanced JavaScript course at GoIT Neoversity. Each task demonstrates different aspects of working with JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and working with third-party libraries.

### Task 1: Image Gallery
Create an image gallery using the SimpleLightbox library to display images in a lightbox when clicked. This task involves setting up the project with npm, importing the library, and using ES6 modules.

### Task 2: Video Player
Create a video player using the Vimeo Player API. The player should save the current playback time to local storage and resume from that time upon page reload. The lodash.throttle library is used to limit how often the time is saved.

### Task 3: Feedback Form
Create a feedback form that saves the user's input to local storage in real-time using lodash.throttle to limit updates. When the page is reloaded, the form should populate with the saved data, and the data should be cleared from local storage upon form submission.
